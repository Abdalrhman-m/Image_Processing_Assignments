## üìÅ Repository Structure


Each folder corresponds to one assignment ‚Äúsheet‚Äù. You‚Äôll typically find Python scripts and/or notebooks plus input images for experiments. (Repo overview shows two sheets and Python as the primary language.) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## üéØ Learning Goals

- Apply fundamental image processing operations (point operations, filtering, edge/feature detection, morphology).
- Understand image transforms (Fourier/DFT, Hough, geometric transforms).
- Practice segmentation and thresholding (Otsu, adaptive, region-based).
- Compare results visually and quantitatively (PSNR/SSIM where relevant).
- Build clean, reproducible experiments.

> If a sheet focuses on specific topics (e.g., histogram equalization, Gaussian vs. median filtering, canny edges), document that in the sheet‚Äôs own mini-README or notebook header.
